## Introduction

**Optics** are a powerful tool in certain niche areas of programming, but they can be confusing and intimidating, especially for those coming from a more traditional programming background. What are optics, why would one use them, and should you care? This post will explore each of these questions.

This is not a comprehensive overview of optics, nor is it an explanation of how they work. Rather, it is an introduction to the topic, motivated by the problem they were designed to solve.

## Classic Getters/Setters

The core concept involves data "getters and setters", so let's look at a traditional example:

```java
class Email {
  // i.e. local@domain
  String local = null;
  String domain = null;

  public Email(String local, String domain) { ... }

  public String getLocal() { return this.local; }

  public void setLocal(String local) { this.local = local; }

  public String getDomain() { return this.domain; }

  public void setDomain(String domain) { this.domain = domain; }
}
```

The getters (`getLocal` and `getDomain`) are used to retrieve the field while the setters (`setLocal` and `setDomain`) are used to set the field.

```java
Email emailVar = new Email (...);

// get fields
String localVar = emailVar.getLocal();
String domainVar = emailVar.getDomain();

// set fields
emailVar.setLocal("username");
emailVar.setDomain("domain.com");
```

We can view `getLocal` as a function that takes an `Email` (implicit `this`) and returns a `String`. Similarly, `setLocal` can be viewed as a function that takes a `String`, an `Email` (`this`), and returns a new `Email` (modified `this`). That is:

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \text{getLocal} : \text{Email} \to \text{String} \\
  & \text{setLocal} : \text{String} \times \text{Email} \to \text{Email}
\end{align*}
$$

Together, a getter + setter pair for a given field represents a way to "focus" on a particular field.

A nice thing about typical getters/setters is that they can be _composed_. That is, if we have

```java
class Customer {
  Integer cid = 0;
  Email email = null;

  public Email getEmail() { return this.email; }
  public void setEmail(Email email) { this.email = email; }
}
```

Then we can compose the getters/setters together:

```java
Customer customerVar = new Customer (...);

String localVar = customerVar.getEmail().getLocal();

customerVar.getEmail().setLocal("username");
```

## Haskell Getters/Setters

Optics are most commonly used in Haskell, so let's look at how we would replicate the above java. First, let's create the equivalent types.

```haskell
data Email
  = MkEmail
    { local :: String,
      domain :: String
    }

data Customer
  = MkCustomer
    { cid :: Integer,
      email :: Email
    }
```

With this "record syntax" haskell gives us "selectors" that are similar to java getters/setters.

```haskell
-- analogous to "email.getLocal()". Notice this is "backwards" as the 'local'
-- and 'domain' fields are essentially functions.
--
-- local : Email -> String
-- domain : Email -> String
let localVar :: String
    localVar = local emailVar

    domainVar :: String
    domainVar = domain emailVar
```

Updates are more interesting. Data in haskell is _immutable_ i.e. once you declare something it is constant; it cannot be changed. This is an enormously useful feature, but it poses a problem. Even if we do not need true mutability, we often want to _model_ it. How do we do this in an immutable world? Well, we have to create _new_ data that copies the old fields over together with the new field.

```haskell
-- Replicating emailVar.setLocal("username"). Analogous to
-- Email newEmail = new Email("username", emailVar.getDomain())
let newEmail :: Email
    newEmail = MkEmail "username" (domain emailVar)
```

Luckily, haskell provides an "update syntax" that makes this more reasonable.

```haskell
-- Analogous to emailVar.setLocal("username")
let newEmail :: Email
    newEmail = emailVar { local = "username" }
```

Make no mistake, in neither case are we actually modifying the original `emailVar`. It is constant. We are creating a new email with the fields we want, thus _modeling_ mutability, which is usually all we need.

## The problem

So far this works well, ergonomics notwithstanding. What about the nested case? Getting works fine:

```haskell
-- customerVar.getEmail().getLocal()
let localVar :: String
    localVar = local (email customerVar)
```

It is update that is the problem. The update syntax we saw earlier cannot be nested. That is, the following is not legal:

```haskell
-- customerVar.getEmail().setLocal("username")
let newCustomer :: Customer
    newCustomer = customerVar { email = { local = "username" } }
```

We are thus stuck copying fields manually:

```haskell
let -- newEmail = customerVar.getEmail().set("username");
    newEmail :: Email
    newEmail = (email customerVar) { local = "username" }

    -- newCustomer = new Customer(customerVar.getCid(), newEmail)
    newCustomer :: Customer
    newCustomer = MkCustomer (cid customerVar) newEmail
```

It is as if we had to do the following in java:

```java
// rather than customerVar.getEmail().setLocal("username")

// create newEmail with the new field
Email newEmail = new Email("username", emailVar.getDomain());
// create a new Customer w/ our changed field
Customer newCustomer = new Customer(customerVar.getCid(), newEmail);
```

Obviously this does not scale at all. Something like:

```java
x.getA().getB().setC(new C(5));
```

would become

```java
C newC = new C(5);
B newB = new B(newC);
A newA = new A(newB);
x newX = new X(newA);
```

God help you if your data is complicated (e.g. has many fields, lists, etc.). In other words, _nested_ updates and immutable data do not mix well. It is this problem that optics are designed to solve.

## Lenses

There are many types of optics, but for our purposes we will only consider **lenses**, arguably the easiest to motivate. Lenses take the idea of a "getter/setter pair" and turn this into actual data. Without getting into the implementation, a lens in haskell looks something like:

```haskell
emailLocalLens :: Lens Email String
```

That is, `emailLocalLens` represents the concept of "getting and setting the field local" on the type `Email`. This gives us an alternative to the selectors used before:

```haskell
-- Like email.getLocal(). 'view' is a function that takes in a lens, data, and
-- "activates" the getter portion of the lens to get the desired field. Morally,
--
-- view :: Lens s a -> s -> a
let localVar :: String
    localVar = view emailLocalLens emailVar

-- Like email.setLocal("username"). 'set' is a function that takes in a lens, the
-- new value, data, and "activates" the setter portion of the lens to set the
-- desired field. Morally,
--
-- set :: Lens s a -> a -> s -> s
let newEmail :: Email
    newEmail = set emailLocalLens "username" emailVar
```

This is why lenses are referred to as "first class getters/setters". Rather than having some syntax built into the language (e.g. java methods), lenses are just like anything else in haskell: a type we can define ourselves that implements the "getter/setter" concept with respect to some data.

At this point you would be forgiven for wondering what that point is. This seems like a lot of work just to come up with a worse syntax. Why go through all this trouble? The crucial advantage that lenses have over traditional haskell updates is that they can be _composed_. Remember the previous example?

```haskell
let newEmail = (email customerVar) { local = "username" }
    newCustomer = MkCustomer (cid customerVar) newEmail
```

With lenses we don't have to manually copy over all the old data:

```haskell
-- customerEmailLens is a lens for the email field on the Customer type
customerEmailLens :: Lens Customer Email

let -- We can freely compose (combine) lenses together e.g.
    --
    --   emailLocalLens :: Lens Email String
    --   customerEmailLens :: Lens Customer Email
    --
    --   customerEmailLens . emailLocalLens :: Lens Customer String
    customerLocalLens :: Lens Customer String
    customerLocalLens = customerEmailLens . emailLocalLens

    -- we now have our customerVar.getEmail().setLocal("username")!
    newCustomer :: Customer
    newCustomer = set customerLocalLens "username" customerVar
```

The advantage is easily seen with the "extreme" example:

```java
x.getA().getB().setC(new C(5));
```

```haskell
let newX = set (aLens . bLens . cLens) 5 x
```

Thus we arrive at the primary motivation. Even if we do not need **true** mutability, we often need to model it. This can be quite difficult with immutable data. Unless our language provides special syntax for it, we have to manually recreate the data. Lenses exist to recover the ergonomics of mutability (i.e. nested getters/setters) in an immutable world.

## Should you care?

If you are working in an environment with immutable data then lenses (and other optics) are certainly worth being aware of. They are never necessary, but they can make life much easier.

However, this is not the world inhabited by most programming. For better or worse, most programming languages fully embrace true mutability, thus we immediately have access to nested getters/setters. In this world, should you care about lenses?

Probably not, as a major motivator is gone. Java doesn't have this problem as all data is mutable, thus there is little need to torture yourself trying to implement lenses in java (of course, [masochism exists](https://github.com/Mojang/DataFixerUpper/blob/master/src/main/java/com/mojang/datafixers/optics/Lens.java)).

To put it more directly, you do not typically want to use lenses for their own sake, as an alternative to normal getters/setters. You use them because you want to use immutable data, and lenses help immutability suck less.

## Addendum

While composition is the primary motivation for lenses, it isn't the only advantage.

In java you are mildly screwed if you want to update a field, rather than just set it.

```java
C c = x.getA().getB().getC();
c.setVal(c.getVal() + 1); // can't do this inline
x.getA().getB().setC(c);
```

Lenses handle this just fine:

```haskell
-- 'over' takes in a lens, a _function_, and the data to modify. Morally,
--
--- over :: Lens s a -> (a -> a) -> s -> a
let newX = over (aLens . bLens . cLens) (+1) x
```

When people say lenses are more powerful than traditional getters/setters, this is what they mean. Because lenses are just ordinary data, we can manipulate them like anything else and define custom behavior (in this case `over` for _modifying_ a field, rather than `set`).

Lenses are just one example of an **optic**. For instance, **prisms** are another type of optic that adapts the lens concept to sum types.
